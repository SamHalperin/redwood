By Sam Halperin

This "apple-study" (think competitive analysis, but more scholarly) is of the Ten Percent Happier

=========
It should be straightforward to just clone the project and open it in Android Studio.  There are two modules,the app is in 'sample' and some UI code that I have aspirations to reuse is in 'library'.
